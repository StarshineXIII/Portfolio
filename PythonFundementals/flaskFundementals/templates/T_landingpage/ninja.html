<p>A ninja (忍者) or shinobi (忍び) was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan. The functions of the ninja included espionage, sabotage, infiltration, assassination and guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>The black masked suit of the ninja enters the historical record in the period of peace after 1600. There is no historical evidence to show that ninja ever wore this garb; most documents point to shinobi wearing standard Japanese clothes of the time: white uniforms for full moons, black for darker nights and no mask or sword on the back. A ninja might use disguise when walking among the enemy, strong clothes and solid footwear when performing night raids and lighter less restricting attire when infiltrating houses – none of which would have included a mask. Furthermore, in all the shinobi documents left behind only one “ninja throwing star” is mentioned and even then it’s in reference to shinobi working in peacetime to apprehend criminals.</p>
